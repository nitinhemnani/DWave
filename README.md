Crew Pairing: Budget Airways is required to assign its crews based in New York to cover all the upcoming scheduled flights. There are many possible sequences of flights that are feasible for a crew to choose from, assuming one crew can only be assigned to one sequence. In Table 1, 10 flights and 8 feasible sequences of flights are viewed respectively as requirements and activities of the set covering problem. The associated cost of each sequence of flight is also listed in this table. The problem is to find a crew assignment that covers all 10 flights at a minimal total cost.
